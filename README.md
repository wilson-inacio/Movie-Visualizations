# Movie Visualizations
## Learn Python for Data Science Portfolio Project


### Overview

This project is one of the portfolio projects on the Data Science pathway at codecademy. In it, I will be inspecting, cleaning and analysing a dataset.
With this analysis, I hope to answer questions like:
 - What are the most popular genre, director and rating (R, PG, NC-17, ...)
 - What is the return ratio for the movies, its average by genre and its impact on score
 - What is the impact of budget and runtime on score
 - How scores, budgets and runtimes changed acrros the years
 - Which directors work more often with wich stars and which writers
   
The project code and results are contained in the Jupyter Notebook Movie-Data.ipynb, with a summary of the conclusions below.

The libraries and dependencies used were:<br>
Python (3.13.5)<br>
numpy==2.3.2<br>
pandas==2.3.2

### The data

The dataset I chose was downloaded from [kaggle.com]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/movies-updated-data/data) . It contains a collection of data movie-related, gathered from various sources, including imdb.
