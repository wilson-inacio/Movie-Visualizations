# Movie Visualizations
## Learn Python for Data Science Portfolio Project


### Overview

This project is one of the portfolio projects on the Data Science pathway at codecademy. In it, I will be inspecting, cleaning and analysing a dataset.
With this analysis, I hope to answer questions like:
 - What are the most popular genres, directors and ratings (R, PG, NC-17, ...)?
 - What is the return ratio for the movies, its average by genre and its impact on score?
 - How scores, budgets and runtimes changed across the years
 - Which directors work more often with which stars and which writers
   
The project code and results are contained in the Jupyter Notebook Movie-Data.ipynb, with a summary of the conclusions below.

The libraries and dependencies used were:
Python (3.13.5)
numpy: 2.3.2
pandas: 2.3.2

### The data

The dataset I chose was downloaded from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/movies-updated-data/data). It contains a collection of movie-related data, gathered from various sources including IMDb, over 20 years, from 1980 to 2001.
